# Brief Description:

The main file is "run.sh" that calls two scripts sequentially

NMSEvsSNR.m : the script to obtain results in Fig. 2
EARvsNumberofMeasurements.m : the script to obtain results in Fig. 3

All other functions are called by the these two scripts.
# Notes: 

This set of code was tested on MATLAB_R2021_a
